reduce is a JavaScript array method that takes an array of values and reduces it to a single value by repeatedly applying a function to the elements of the array. It starts with an initial value and accumulates the result of each iteration of the function, ultimately returning a single value.

For example, you could use reduce to sum all the values in an array of numbers:

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const sum = numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue, 0);

console.log(sum); // 15

Explain :- 
Here, the reduce function starts with an initial value of 0, and for each iteration, it adds the current value to the accumulator. After all iterations, the final value of the accumulator is returned, which is the sum of all the numbers in the array.

Example :- 
const arr = [5, 1, 3, 2, 6];

//sum or max

function findSum (arr)
{
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        sum = sum + arr[i];
        
    }

    return sum;
}

console.log(findSum(arr));

How we transform this logic and use reduce instead.
