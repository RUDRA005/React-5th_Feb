=> The accumulator and currentValue are parameters used in the callback function passed to reduce.
=> The accumulator is the value that accumulates the result of each iteration of the function, and the currentValue is the current value being processed in the array.

Here's an example to help clarify: 👇

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const sum = numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {
  console.log("accumulator: ", accumulator);
  console.log("currentValue: ", currentValue);
  return accumulator + currentValue;
}, 0);

console.log(sum);

👍 OUT PUT 👍

accumulator:  0
currentValue:  1
accumulator:  1
currentValue:  2
accumulator:  3
currentValue:  3
accumulator:  6
currentValue:  4
accumulator:  10
currentValue:  5
15

👉 :- In the first iteration, accumulator is equal to the initial value 0 and currentValue is equal to 1. The function returns 0 + 1, which becomes the new value of the accumulator.

👉 :- In the next iteration, accumulator is equal to 1 and currentValue is equal to 2. The function returns 1 + 2, which becomes the new value of the accumulator.


👉 :- This process continues until all the values in the array have been processed, and the final value of the accumulator is returned, which in this case is 15.
